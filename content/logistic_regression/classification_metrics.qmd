## Metrics for logistic regression

### Accuracy

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified predictions, both positive and negative, out of all predictions.

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
$$

Accuracy is useful when the classes are **balanced** as a high accuracy means the model can effectively differentiate between outcomes; however, in imbalanced datasets, the model can achieve high accuracy by predicting the majority class all of the time.

### Recall

Recall measures the proportion of actual positives that the model is able to identify.

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
$$

Recall is vital when the cost of missing a true positive is high, such as in medicine where failing to identify a disease can have fatal consequences.

### Precision

Precision measures the proportion of positive predictions that were actually correct.

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
$$

Precision is critical when the cost of a false positive is high, for example, in spam email classification where important emails may be misclassified as spam.

### F1-Score

The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall which provides a metric that balances the tradeoff between them.

$$
\text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$

It can be particularly useful when precision and recall both matter, i.e. when false positives and false negatives are equally important, such as in search engine results.

### ROC Curve and AUC

The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve plots the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate at different classification thresholds. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) quantifies the overall ability of the model to distinguish between classes. The true positive rate is all the proportion of true positives over all actual positives. The false positive rate is the proportion of false positives over all actual negatives.

$$
\text{TPR} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
$$

$$
\text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{TN} + \text{FP}}
$$
